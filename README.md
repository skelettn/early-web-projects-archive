# Early Web Projects Archive (2021-2023)

This repository is a collection of web projects I developed between 2021 and 2023, during my first steps into web development (ages 17 to 19). 

Looking back, these projects represent a period of high ambition paired with very limited technical experience. My goal at the time was often to build the next major social platform or a world-class streaming service, leading to a lot of experimental (and often messy) PHP code. I am sharing these here as a personal archive and to show my evolution as a developer.

## Disclaimer
These projects are for historical and educational purposes only.
* **Code Quality:** This reflects my learning process at the time. The architecture is often inconsistent and the code contains various anti-patterns.
* **Security:** These projects were built without modern security standards in mind. They contain vulnerabilities and should never be deployed in a production environment.
* **Privacy:** All real credentials and personal database entries have been removed or anonymized.

## Projects in this Archive

### 1. COOLINK (2021)
A link-in-bio and URL management service. This was my first attempt at building a SaaS-style platform. It includes a URL shortener, a user dashboard, and customizable profile pages. At the time, I focused heavily on the visual aspect of the landing pages while discovering the basics of backend logic.
* **Stack:** PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap.

### 2. TousVosFilms (2022)
A movie and series indexing platform. The objective for this project was to create a high-traffic streaming community. It features a custom UI centered around dark mode and glassmorphism, with functionalities for user watchlists and content filtering.
* **Stack:** PHP, MySQL, Custom CSS.

### 3. [KIJU](./KIJU) (2023)
A social community prototype. This was my most complex project during this period, focusing on social interactions and community management. It features more advanced CSS animations and a more structured (albeit still primitive) approach to community building.
* **Stack:** PHP, MySQL, JavaScript.
