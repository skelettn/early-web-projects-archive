# KIJU - The Social Network Prototype (2023) 💜

KIJU was my most ambitious project: the ultimate "Facebook-killer." I wanted to build a community-driven platform with modern aesthetics and slick animations.

## Features
- Community creation and administration.
- Social sharing (Posts, Photos, Videos).
- High-end (at the time) CSS animations and transitions.
- Interactive landing pages.

## Technical Details
- **Stack:** PHP & MySQL.
- **Frontend:** Advanced custom CSS and interactive JS.
